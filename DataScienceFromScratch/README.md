Data Science from Scratch (Joel Grus)
=====================================

This is my Jupyter Notebooks on **Data Science from Scratch** book examples.

Here's all the code and examples from my book __[Data Science from Scratch](http://joelgrus.com/2015/04/26/data-science-from-scratch-first-principles-with-python/)__. The `code` directory contains Python 2.7 versions, and the `code-python3` direction contains the Python 3 equivalents. (I tested them in 3.5, but they should work in any 3.x.)
